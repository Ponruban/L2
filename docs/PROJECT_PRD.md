# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Project Vision
To empower internal development teams with a unified, intuitive dashboard for managing projects, tracking progress, and optimizing resource usage, resulting in improved productivity, transparency, and collaboration.

### Goals
- Centralize project and task management for development teams.
- Enable efficient tracking of milestones, tasks, and resource allocation.
- Foster team collaboration and accountability.
- Provide actionable insights through reporting and visual indicators.

### Overview

## 5. Business Rules

- Only authorized users can create, edit, or archive projects.
- Tasks must be associated with a project and optionally a milestone.
- Each task must have an assignee, priority, deadline, and status.
- Comments and file attachments are only visible to project members.
- Time logs are immutable after submission (or require admin override to edit).
- Notifications are sent based on user preferences (email, in-app, or both).
- Archived projects are read-only and excluded from active filters.
- **Only users with edit access (e.g., Project Managers, Team Leads) can assign tasks to other users.**
- **All users can change the status of tasks, add comments, and create new tasks, but assigning a task to a user requires specific edit access.**
- **Only users with edit access can create, delete, or update available task statuses (e.g., add new status types or remove existing ones).**

## 6. Data Models / Entities (High-Level)

- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `role`, `preferences`
- **Project**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, `milestones[]`, `members[]`
- **Milestone**: `id`, `project_id`, `name`, `due_date`, `status`
- **Task**: `id`, `project_id`, `milestone_id`, `title`, `description`, `assignee_id`, `priority`, `status`, `deadline`, `comments[]`, `attachments[]`, `time_logs[]`
- **Comment**: `id`, `task_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `timestamp`
- **Attachment**: `id`, `task_id`, `file_url`, `uploaded_by`, `uploaded_at`
- **TimeLog**: `id`, `task_id`, `user_id`, `hours`, `date`
- **PerformanceAnalytics** (derived): `user_id`, `week/month`, `total_hours_logged`, `average_hours_per_day`, `utilization_rate`
- **TaskBoardView** (derived/UI): `board_id`, `project_id`, `grouping_criteria` (priority, assignee, status, etc.), `columns[]`, `tasks[]`

**Relationships:**
- A Project has many Milestones and Tasks.
- A Task belongs to a Project and optionally a Milestone.
- A Task has many Comments, Attachments, and TimeLogs.
- Users can be members of multiple Projects.
